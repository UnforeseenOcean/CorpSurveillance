                I had been a Verizon customer for 30 years. Verizon treated me very badly. I spoke to a Supervisor and from the time she got on the call her attitude and tone was, "How can i get rid of this guy?"                 <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                I am irritated that my IPhone 5 will not hold a charge. I have to have it constantly plugged in. I feel like it should be attached to a Rotary Dail Phone.  At this point after 4 hours still not turning on. More irritating is having insurance on the phone but need to ship out to Apple, pay extra money and no local repairs will be done by Verizon. At this point they know this is a customer issue...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                Had service over 15  years in the last few years service has degraded. I was over charged for years on things the customer reps make mistakes on,  received  misinformation, poor customer service phone and tech support and more. Feed up since they could not get the service or phone to work properly, spent so  hours of my time  just wasted so told them would have to leave. Called  before closing...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                Two weeks ago on 11-16-2015, after being a Verizon customer for over 7 years, Verizon disconnected my phone land line for no reason.  After endless hours on the phone on hold, having to listen to HORRIBLE music, being disconnected many, many times and having to call back again, despite the fact that a call back number was given to the customer representative, dealing with incompetent customer...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                My husband and I have been with Verizon for 12 years without a single issue. Recently we had a passed due bill, several online payments were scheduled and then canceled while we had hoped the funds would be there to pay and they weren't. (There was an issue with the bank, long story) We paid by credit card and then we're no longer past due. We received several texts messages and phone calls after...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

They had to send out a tech to do the install, they weren't prepared at all and didn't have the right amount of cable boxes.   -I was promised a $400 gift card for signing up, I was also told that downgrading my packages wouldn't result in an early termination fee.  I now find that both things are false.  The customer service rep promised me one package, gave me another,...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->
