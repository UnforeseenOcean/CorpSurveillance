                                                Updated to Windows 10 (free) - 3 days later = Blue Screen shutdown.  Tried everything to recover with no luck.  Finally had to take to the shop to recover data, remove 10 and re-install Windows 7.  Total cost $198.59!  Tech(s) advised to stay away from 10 for a while.  This is my 1st major problem with Microsoft and I've been on-line since 1991, strictly a PC user but am looking at Macs more...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                Microsoft is spamming me with pop-ups whenever I open Outlook or boot up windows. There is NO option to click whereby I can decline the offer to upgrade. If I remove the update that installed this on my computer, it automatically downloads again with the next Windows update. This is a desperate form of extortion from Microsoft. I WILL be going with Apple next time. I even tried "Hiding" the...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                I have been using Windows products, both at home and at work, for as long as I can remember.  When I received the offer of a free upgrade to Windows 10, I knew to expect some technical bugs and glitches.  What I did not anticipate was the complete loss of my laptop’s functionality as well the loss of all programs, pictures, documents and music. I accepted the upgrade and after a month, I turned...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                I made the mistake of updating to W.10 as soon as I could. Not too bad in the beginning, except that it would disable Chrome browser every time it updated. I was able to work around it and resume using chrome. As time went by it became more and more intrusive until it was a major hassle. I tried at that point to revert back to W.8.1 but found out I had waited too long and can't go back any more....                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->
