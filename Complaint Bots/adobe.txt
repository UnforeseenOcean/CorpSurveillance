                                                During my final semester as a Uni student I was hoping to cancel my month-to-month subscription as I won't be needing it anymore. Little did i know that while I was compiling my major project I had stumbled across a link "10 FREE STOCK PHOTOS FOR ONE MONTH". As it is hard to find good quality images to use in projects and seeing as it was my Final big project I decided to use the opportunity. I...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                it is Friday Nov 27, not a holiday in Canada or the u.S. Adobe Creative cloud has a 20 per cent off special and today is the last day.  I'm trying to sign up for a Student plan before the day is over. I cannot get the form elements to work, despite trying about 50 different fixes and four computers, calling Adobe (customer support closed for the 'holiday) WHAT KIND OF STORE HAS A SALE ON BLACK...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                I've had a monthly subscription for Adobe XI for about 3 years.  During that time I tried to switch to a cheaper monthly service with commitment for one year.  I was talked out of it.  Recently, I tried to switch to it again, but was a bit late on my last payment. FIRST RED FLAG.   I called customer service and you only get people from India.  Was told that all I had to do was make the the missed...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                I have had Adobe Dreamweaver for 3 years and it has never worked It took me 3 years to talk to someone at Adobe. It was a complete waste of time. The whole organisation is a joke. I would advise anyone considering purchasing or even using for free any Adobe product. They don't even have anywhere that you can make a complaint to. They are a complete waste of space. They were unable to tell me how...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                There was Google Chrome Piggy-Backing on Adobe Update. It installed without asking my permission. Adobe have NO RIGHT to force other programs from other companies onto us or our computers. If we walked into any Adobe worker's house and painted it mauve without their knowledge they'd go ape-*** but when they do stuff to our computers without our knowledge or consent it's not only annoying, it's...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                Adobe Flash Player update installed Google Chrome with it. If I'd wanted Chrome I'd download and install it. Companies should not force other software onto us, into our computers by piggy-backing them on their product. Adobe won't let you email to tell them how rude, annoying and unfair this practise is. Half an hour checking no other *** has been installed, luckily not. How can a company not...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                I ordered Adobe PDF, but it didn't work well.  So I stopped using it.  A year later they renew the service (after they had emailed to tell me that it was stopping).  I used their support and was promised a refund.  2 weeks later I called again and was promised again.  A month later the same thing happened.  And today marks the 4th time.  Each time they promise it is fixed and I will get the...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                They advertise for $9.99/month and that you can cancel at any time. I noticed when I went through final payment process at the end that the option for $9.99/month was signing me up for an annual, year-long contract that you must cancel within 30 days if you don't want to be charged $9.99 a month. Well, I wrote myself a note, but I was so busy that when that deadline came I forgot to cancel. I got...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->
