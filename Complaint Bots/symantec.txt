No idea what's going on so I log in online (please note that I had to have been online to have logged in online). I try to view history and Norton says pc not connected to the internet. I try the online chat; chat is too busy to connect to me. I get a phone number  for my area and website...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                I have an issue with Norton 360 Online Backup - it does not complete.  Got support on 8/8/14 and thought that everything was OK but found it odd that the size of the free space for my online backup did not match the figures of my Total Capacity less my Existing Backups. The figures seem to be about 5GB out! Support left me running a backup of over 70,000 files and around 62GB total file size....                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                Bought Symantec EndPoint Protection. After I eventually found some useful information on there overcomplicated website I called Symantec Business Support to ask for advice on what files to download. INDIAN CALL CENTER. The telephone was answered but the operator did not speak for close to one minute. Then he said,  "What?". Spoke to a second operator who was equally as rude. Tried to cancel the...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                Installed Adobe Reader and ended up with seven add ons that I didn't want including Norton Security Scan.  I tried removing via XP Add/Remove.  Each time it would not/could not remove it.  I have gone into XP My Computer and located the Norton Progrm Folder.  I have deleted the folder.  It was saved to the Trash and I emptied the Trash.  I have now gone through restore point and restored the...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                Symantic's Norton anti-virus package has been ineffective in carrying out its appointed task of protecting my HP desk-top PC such that I sometimes only half-jokingly refer to it as a pro-virus package.  My money was clearly poorly spent.  It is a constant source of irritation and insult to me that, whenever I am on my PC, I am forced to view the icons of the rogue viruses that continue to go on...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                I was charged a fee of $49.99 to have a technician remote access my laptop to remove a virus and re-install Norton.  It took four hours and two technicians to NOT accomplish this...or much of anything else, except waste my time.  I was given a seven day window for a refund.  It is now the fourth day and I have yet to get a refund or get a hold of anyone in billing, where I have been transferred...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                Norton internet security failed to update properly. After 40 minutes on hold, symantec havenot resolved it and won't take a complaint. Indian call centre. Doesn't have a clue. it's cost me over Â£5 in phone calls. Are symantec trying to make their profits from pissed off consumers? As a business model it stinks! Apparently symatec are upgrading their servers so live update doesn't work. But the...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->
