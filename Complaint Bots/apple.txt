                                                Apple just sucks and gets sucker by the minute.  My latest complaint:  I switched bank accounts, closing one and opening another.  When I attempt to do anything now having anything to do with the Apple Store, I have to fill-in all my new debit card info, and then get a message saying my transaction has been declined.  Well, my bank isn't declining anything, MasterCard shows on each one that it...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                I have a brand new iphone 6S Plus ordered from Sprint. It is dead after more than two weeks. I stop by Apple Store for a repair. The technician there told me they have to ship it to Service Center in CA for further diagnostic. After more than a week, Apple Store call me that they do not honor the warranty because there is a unauthorized modification in the iphone. They said either I pay $749 for...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                In May 2015 I walked into a DC area Apple store and purchased what I was told was a sim-free IPhone 6 Plus with 128gb capacity for $950.  Shortly after using it I noticed that the battery rapidly drained, even faster than my 2012 IPad 3.  Because of this I did some research via web and found an article with text about Apple's admitting to placing disfunctional batteries in Iphones, so I went back...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                I bought an iPad Mini at Staples last June, after owning and being very satisfied with my iMac.  The store listed several models as part of a sale, none of which they had in stock, so the sales man offered me a returned one for $25 less.  He said all sold and returned iPads must be returned to Apple but this one hadn't yet gone.  It seemed unused, so I bought it. It never worked.  In the...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                Hey Apple, I am stunned by the type of customer service i was given by one of your staff . She was exceptionally rude and  felt as if she was racially discriminating me based on my accent or whatever it is .  I had never got this type of response from any Apple CS and they had always been nice . I tried contacting CS via my phone chat and it got disconnected twice due to network issue and both...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                My Genisis appt. was made in the Apple Store, waited 5 days for repairs to my iPhone to learn there was not an appt for me.  As a "senior," I'd rather have a root canal than to go to the Rancho Cucumango, CA Apple Store!!  Each time I enter I have to explain my needs 3/4 times.  Such poor treatment. This is my 3rd iPhone and my last!!   As I meet and speak with seniors across the country,...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

I had spent a lot of time combing through all my music and setting up a playlist and all of them are gone. What the *** did you guys do to ITunes? If this is not fixed, I will remove ITunes from my computer and all my other devises and never use it again. I will find other application that are available for my music. This is such ***, I'm not...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->

                                                my experience with apple support was very positive.I broke my phon and bought anew one with a discount by an insurer, who requested that I return the phone to them.Well, later they requested that we turn off "find my iphone". We didn't have the phone(or the serial number)and we hadn't recorded the apple ID or password so we couldn't  do any thing to turn it off. We contacted customer support and...                <!--INFOLINKS_OFF-->
